											<h1>Howdy! I'm Eric.</h1>
											<p>Welcome to my little corner of the web.</p>
										</header>
										<p>With over six years of experience in program operations, grants management, and customer service, I have a diverse skillset that can be applied easily to various roles in the philanthropic and non-profit sectors. For most of my career, I've focused on working with socially responsible, progressively-minded organizations that promote human rights and democratic values in the US and abroad.</p>

										<p>I have been working with the <a href="https://www.russellsage.org">Russell Sage Foundation</a> since 2013, and in my current role as a Program Associate since February 2020.</p>

												<h3>Program Operations</h3>
												<p>At RSF, I've been an integral part of the foundation's operations team on both sides of the grantmaking process, pre- and post-award. I advise potenital grantees on RSF's programs and eligibility, and I shepherd them through crafting a successful grant proposal and navigating the rigorous review process. Post-award, I assure compliance with budgetary and reporting guidelines. I also handle logistics for in-house conferences of grantees.</p>

												<h3>GIS & Data Analysis</h3>
												<p>Nowadays real power lies in data, and I have the know-how to crunch the numbers, identify trends, and express them in visually dynamic ways, especially geospatially. I have working knowledge of ArcGIS (the standard in GIS), as well as mapping and data visualization platforms like Carto, Mapbox, and Tableau.</p>

												<h3>Research & Writing</h3>
												<p>As part of their communications teams, I've written features for the International Center for Transitional Justice and Roosevelt Institute, and I've conducted in-depth research projects for UN OCHA, and the International Rescue Committee, the latter in the field (see Projects below). For RSF, I drove an effort to identify key demographic trends for our grantmaking efforts, and I often summarize research projects and trends for board of trustee meetings.</p>

												<h3>Customer Service</h3>
												<p>My professional experience was built upon a strong foundation of customer service managing a boutiqe fitness studio and day spa, and I draw from this experience every day in interactions with coworkers, as well as with current and prospective grantees, in order to streamline and simplify essential processes as smoothly as possible.</p>

											<h3>Going Forward: Donor Recommendations for Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) in Iraq</h3>
											<p>This report (written from the perspective of a donor) considered options for DDR in Iraq following the recapture of ISIL-controlled territory by coalition forces in 2017. Amid widespread destruction and massive displacement, gains against ISIL signalled a possibile turning point. As a modicum of stability finally appeared within sight, the question of whether or not a DDR program in Iraq was feasible arose. Noting that the UN previously implemented several programs in Afghanistan under similar circumstances and failed, I argued that despite the risk, if done correctly and mindfully, a DDR initative could contribute toward a long-term peace.</p>

											<h3>Mapping Measures of Fragility</h3>
											<p>For this project, I compared different measures of state fragility across countries on a single, interactive map, created using Carto, Mapbox, and Javascript. The data is from six different datasets compiled by NGOs and intergovernmental agencies: Freedom House’s <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018">Freedom in the World 2018</a> and <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-media/freedom-media-2019">Freedom of the Press 2017</a> datasets, UNDP’s <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">Human Development Index 2015</a>, the <a href="https://fragilestatesindex.org/">Fragile States Index 2017</a> by the Fund for Peace, the World Bank’s <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI">Gini Index 2015</a>, and Transparency International’s <a href="https://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview">Corruption Perceptions Index 2017</a>. Since each index measures a different aspect of fragility from the perspective of different organizations with their own specialties and biases, new comparisons and insights can be gained.</p>

											<h3>Walking Blind: Mapping the Information Gaps of Syrian Refugees in Jordan</h3>
											<p>How might humanitarians enable refugees to have access to complete, timely, and easily digestible information so that they are well-informed, receive the maximum level of care available, and are less likely to be subjected to a potentially dangerous or life-threatening situation when undertaking a return? Following a week in Amman, Jordan consulting with the <a href="https://www.rescue.org/">International Rescue Committee (IRC)</a> and representatives from other humanitarian NGOs working on durable solutions for Syrian refugees, I explored the different needs, risks, moral implications, and benefits of a tool to reduce information gaps for Syrian refugees considering a spontaneous return.</p>

											<h3>Tomorrow is Too Late: A Renewed Focus on Anticipatory Financing</h3>
											<p>For my capstone project, my team consulted with <a href="https://www.unocha.org/">UN OCHA</a> on formulating an outreach strategy for increasing the use of anticipatory financing methods, specifically with regard to famine relief. The yearlong project culminated in two informational pamphlets and a promotional video (with a separate version translated into Arabic), each meant to educate general audiences and engage high-level stakeholders on the need for policy that is less reactive and more effective.</p>
